#Context for Agentic AI
This file is to provide AI agents with sufficient context of this solution so that I don't have to retrain the agent at
the start of every session.

Update 2026-02-18

Current model version: 0.18.1 (Major.Minor.Patch in `ModelConstants`)

##PersonalFinance Solution Overview

This is a C# .NET 8.0 solution using JetBrains Rider IDE on Linux. The solution consists of the following .net projects:
- ModelTrainer. This project's goal is to employ a strategy similar to model training from the Machine Learning domain
and run generations of a financial Monte Carlo simulations using different parameters (Lib.DataTypes.MonteCarlo.Model) 
to determine which parameters yield the most fun points at the end of multiple simulated lives. The parameters encompass
various aspects of retirement planning, savings, investment, and spending.
- MonteCarloCLI. This project is a command line application used for debugging the MonteCarlo simulation. It's designed
to easily provide specific input parameters and debug through a single Monte Carlo simulation run. 
- PersonalFinance. This project reads the current state of my finances from the PostgreSQL database, uses those as
inputs into the current best Lib.DataTypes.MonteCarlo.Model parameters (as determined through running the ModelTrainer
many times), and provide a visualization layer of the current state of my finances and my likely retirement outlook.
- Lib. This is the library project that encapsulates all the business logic necessary to run the above projects.
- Lb.Tests. This project encapsulates all unit and regression tests for the Lib project.

##Architecture Overview:

- Uses EFCore for data access, xUnit testing, NodaTime for dates, decimal precision for financial calculations
- Core namespaces: `Lib.MonteCarlo.StaticFunctions`, `Lib.DataTypes.MonteCarlo`, `Lib.Tests.MonteCarlo.StaticFunctions`
- Key classes: 
    - `PgContext`: This is the EFCore context file that describes the relationship between data types in the database.
    - `ConfigManager`: Provides static methods to read configuration settings from appsettings.json with type-safe
    parsing for various data types.
    - `TaxConstants`: Contains static readonly arrays and constants defining federal tax brackets, RMD tables, Social
    Security thresholds, and other tax-related calculations.
    - `MonteCarloConfig`: Houses static configuration values that transcend all instances of a simulation run, including
     debug flags, parallel processing settings, and simulation parameters.
    - `ModelConstants`: Defines version information and min/max constraints for all model parameters used in Monte Carlo
    simulation breeding and validation.
    - `Model`: Represents a complete set of parameters for a Monte Carlo simulation run, including retirement dates,
    spending ratios, and investment strategies.
    - `ModelChampion`: Entity class that stores manually designated champion models to protect them from cleanup processes
    - `PgPerson`: Entity class representing a person's basic demographic and financial information stored in the
    PostgreSQL database.
    - `AccountCalculation`: Static utility class providing methods to calculate various account balances and financial
    metrics across different account types.
    - `AccountDebtPayment`: Handles debt payment calculations and operations for various debt account types in the
    simulation.
    - `AccountInterestAccrual`: Manages interest accrual calculations for both debt and investment accounts over time
    periods.
    - `Simulation`: Interprets and aggregates results from multiple life simulation runs into meaningful statistical
    metrics.
    - `SimulationTrigger`: Orchestrates the execution of Monte Carlo simulations, including database operations, model
    breeding, and batch processing.
    - `LifeSimulator`: Executes a complete simulated financial life from start to end, processing monthly financial
    operations and decisions.
    - `IWithdrawalStrategy`: Interface defining the contract for different retirement withdrawal and investment
    strategies.
    - `TaxCalculation`: Provides comprehensive tax calculation methods including federal/state income tax, capital
    gains, RMDs, and Social Security taxation.
    - `InvestmentSales`: Handles the complex logic of selling investments in optimal order for tax efficiency and
    account management.
    - `AccountCashManagement`: Manages cash account operations including deposits, withdrawals, and cascading
    liquidation when insufficient cash is available.
    - `ModelFunc`: Contains utility functions for creating, breeding, and manipulating Monte Carlo simulation models.
    - `MathFunc`: Provides mathematical utility functions including random number generation and statistical operations
    for simulations.
- Common patterns:
    - **Static classes and functions** I want this to be as functional as possible and seldom have business logic in
    classes with instance data. This is to avoid unintended side effects
    - **Creating copies of data structures and returning the copies** Again, this is to be as functional as possible.
    I'm not sure whether this was a smart idea or not, but it's probably too late to change now
    - **Returning tuples** Again, this is to be as functional as possible. I don't want large instance classes. I want
    to pass the data that a static function needs to that static function, have that static function treat the passed in
    data is immutable, and have it return new (changed) instances of the data 
    
##Financial Domain Logic:

- The Monte Carlo simulation Simulates retirement scenarios with multiple account types: Traditional/Roth IRA/401k, HSA,
Taxable Brokerage, Cash
- Investment positions have types: LONG_TERM, MID_TERM, SHORT_TERM (affects tax treatment and growth rates)
- Growth rates: LONG_TERM uses full market growth, MID_TERM uses 50% of market growth (InvestmentConfig.MidTermGrowthRateModifier), SHORT_TERM uses 0% growth
- Tax calculations include: RMDs (start age 73), capital gains (long/short term), IRA distributions
- Withdrawal strategies implement common concepts for investing and withdrawal
    - `BasicBucketsIncomeThreshold`: Withdrawal strategy that uses tax-deferred accounts until reaching higher tax
    brackets, then switches to taxable/tax-free accounts.
    - `BasicBucketsTaxableFirst`: Withdrawal strategy that prioritizes taxable brokerage accounts first, then
    tax-deferred, then tax-free accounts.
    - `SixtyForty`: Simple withdrawal strategy that maintains a configurable split between long-term and mid-term
    position types. It is named SixtyForty because traditional retirement planning sets that ratio at 60% equities and
    40% bonds. Though each Model instance can define its own preferred ratio.
        
##Monte Carlo logic

The Monte Carlo simulation simulates a specified number of imaginary futures for me (Dan, the author) by taking my
current financial state (as of each run) and projecting ahead until my 90th birthday. Each imaginary future life will
endure a different set of hypothetical investment growth rates over time. Each imaginary future life will make financial
decisions based on the parameters in the provided Model instance.

The hypothetical growth rates are consistently calculated such that Model A's life 5 will have identical hypothetical
growth rates as Model B's life 5. But each models' life 5 will have different growth rates from their life 6s.

All future dollars are denominated in "today's" dollar value. This means that we don't try to track inflation. If, at
the end of a simulated life, you have a net worth of $2MM, that will be $2MM of today's dollars, even though it'll be
40 years in the future. All hypothetical growth rates are made up of real-world S&P500 growth rates less a real-world
change in CPI. In other words, all assumed growth is net of inflation.

##Configuration System

Settings are resolved in two steps by `ConfigManager` (Lib/ConfigManager.cs):
1. Check the project's local `appsettings.json` first (local override layer).
2. Fall back to the `personalfinance.configvalue` DB table (universal defaults for all projects).

When adding a new config variable:
- INSERT it into `personalfinance.configvalue` with a default that is safe/correct for all projects.
- Override in a specific project's `appsettings.json` only if that project needs a non-default value
  (e.g. a machine-specific file path, or a feature that is ON for debugging but OFF everywhere else).
- Do NOT put settings that should only be toggled ad-hoc (like a clutch or diagnostic flag) in
  appsettings.json as the primary store — use the DB row and update it with SQL when needed.

##Hypothetical Growth Rate Generation (VAR Model)

As of 2026-02-18, hypothetical lifetime growth rates are generated by a VAR(3) (Vector Autoregression, 3 lags) model
fit entirely in C#, replacing the previous SQL view approach that circular-shifted historical data.

**Why VAR?** The old SQL view wrapped ~552 months of history to produce 600-month lifetimes, causing economically
discontinuous jumps (e.g. 2025's 3% treasury rates slamming into 1980's 15% rates mid-lifetime). VAR instead learns
the autocorrelation structure (bull/bear stretches, recessions) and cross-asset correlations (stocks vs bonds vs
inflation) from the data and generates plausible synthetic sequences.

**Key files:**
- `Lib/MonteCarlo/Var/MatrixMath.cs` — double[,] helpers: Multiply, Transpose, Invert (Gauss-Jordan), CholeskyDecompose
- `Lib/MonteCarlo/Var/VarFitter.cs` — OLS fitting: B=(X'X)⁻¹X'Y, residual covariance Σ, Cholesky factor L; also estimates
  Ornstein-Uhlenbeck parameters (kappa, theta) for treasury via univariate OLS of delta_r on r_{t-1}
- `Lib/MonteCarlo/Var/VarLifetimeGenerator.cs` — generates months via: mean_t = x_t × B, shock = L × z (Box-Muller);
  applies OU mean reversion to treasury rate with floor 0.1% / ceiling 20%
- `Lib/DataTypes/MonteCarlo/VarModel.cs` — immutable record: CoefficientMatrix (10×3), ResidualCholesky (3×3),
  SeedObservations, plus TreasuryOuTheta, TreasuryOuKappa, InitialTreasuryRate
- `Lib/DataTypes/MonteCarlo/HistoricalDataPoint.cs` — EF entity for `personalfinance.historicalgrowth` table;
  includes TreasuryCurrentValue (used to pass rate levels to VarFitter for OU estimation)

**Generation flow (Pricing.cs → SimulationTrigger.cs):**
1. `Pricing.LoadAndFitVarModel()` — loads historicalgrowth rows (year≥1980, all 4 columns non-null including
   TreasuryCurrentValue), converts levels to decimal form (/100), fits VAR(3) with OU params, caches result
2. `Pricing.CreateHypotheticalPricingForARun(VarModel, lifeIndex)` — calls VarLifetimeGenerator with `new Random(lifeIndex)`
   seed; same index = same life across runs
3. `SimulationTrigger.ExecuteSingleModelAllLives()` — fits model once, then iterates lifeIndex 0..NumLivesPerModelRun-1

**HypotheticalLifeTimeGrowthRate** is a plain record with SpGrowth, CpiGrowth, TreasuryGrowth (all decimal) and an
`operator *(r, m) => r.SpGrowth * m` for scaling mid/short-term rates.
- SpGrowth, CpiGrowth — monthly percentage growth rates (multiplicative)
- TreasuryGrowth — absolute monthly change in decimal form (additive); e.g. 0.001 = rate rose 0.1 percentage point

**Treasury rate representation (important for future bond work):**
- `personalfinance.historicalgrowth.treasury_growth` stores `(current - prior) / 100` — absolute monthly change
  in decimal form. A move from 4.0% → 4.1% stores 0.001.
- `CurrentPrices.CurrentTreasuryCoupon` is in decimal form (0.04 = 4%) and is updated additively each month:
  `CurrentTreasuryCoupon += rates.TreasuryGrowth`
- `CurrentTreasuryCoupon` is correctly propagated through `CopyPrices` (bug was fixed 2026-02-19)
- `CurrentTreasuryCoupon` is currently **dead code** — it is computed and propagated correctly but not yet
  consumed by any downstream calculation. Bond asset class implementation will wire it in.

We try to track as close to real-world financial events as we can. Prior to retirement, I will draw a paycheck, pay for
insurance, have taxes withheld, pay bills, spend money on fun stuff, etc. After retirement, I will withdraw from my
accounts to pay for everything. 

The "goal" of model training is to maximize "fun points". When we spend money on fun things, we accrue fun points.
When we have to go to work to afford fun things, that detracts from our fun points. 

##Data / control flow:

- ModelTrainer project
    - Fetch the PgPerson object and historical data (S&P500 and consumer price index data since 1980) from the database
    - Continuously loop. In each loop:
        - Fetch the best 15 models from the database based on past runs
        - Generate 5 new random models
        - Breed all 20 models to each other (resulting in 400 child models) allowing for mutation
        - Run each child model through 100 simulated lifetimes
        - Interpret and record the results in the database
- MonteCarloCli project
    - Fetch the PgPerson object, a specific model, and historical data (S&P500 and consumer price index data since 1980)
    from the database
    - Run 100 simulated lifetimes using that model
    - Alternately, you can uncomment code to run a specific lifetime for easier debugging
- PersonalFinance project
    - Fetch the PgPerson object, a specific model, and historical data (S&P500 and consumer price index data since 1980)
    from the database
    - Run 1000 simulated lifetimes using that model
    - Output an HTML file with graph visualizations of the current financial state of the PgPerson as well as a
    projected future based on Monte Carlo results 

##Model Champion Protection System:

- **ModelChampion Table**: New PostgreSQL table that stores manually designated champion models with timestamp
- **One-to-One Relationship**: Each Model can have one Champion record, enforced by unique constraint
- **Cleanup Protection**: `SimulationTrigger.CleanUpModelAndRunResultsData()` excludes models with champion records from deletion
- **Manual Maintenance**: Champion designation is done manually via SQL, no automated CRUD operations
- **Version Impact**: Champion system is patch-level change (0.18.1) since it doesn't affect simulation outcomes

##Recent Issues Resolved:

- Fixed RMD test failures: RMDs start at age 73 (SECURE Act 2.0), not 72
- Improved statistical test reliability in `GetUnSeededRandomDecimal_IsRandom` with wider tolerances (±10%)
- Use realistic test amounts ($500k balances) vs small values
- Identified redundant test removal needs in `TaxCalculationTestsExtended.cs`
- Implemented SQL performance optimization using NOT EXISTS vs LEFT JOIN + GROUP BY for better query performance

##Testing Patterns:

- `TestDataManager.CreateTest*()` helper methods for consistent test data
- Statistical tests use 100k samples with appropriate tolerance ranges
- InlineData for parameterized tests with edge case considerations (buckets 0/10 get ~50% hits due to rounding)

##Session History:

### Session 2025-09-17 - Context System Setup

- **Issues Addressed:** Established persistent context system between AI sessions for project continuity
- **Solutions Applied:** Created living ClaudeContext.txt file with comprehensive project overview and session tracking
- **Key Discovery:** Minor bug in `InvestmentSales.SellInvestmentsToDollarAmount()` debug messages - line shows "Total
long term capital gains" for both long-term and short-term capital gains logging.
- **Testing Patterns Confirmed:** TestDataManager helper methods, realistic $500k+ test amounts, statistical validation
approaches
- **Outstanding Items:** Consider fixing debug message accuracy in InvestmentSales method

### Session 2025-09-18 Morning - Context Document Evolution

- **Issues Addressed:** Refined and expanded the ClaudeContext.txt document for better AI assistance
- **Solutions Applied:** 
  - Added "Common Patterns" section documenting functional programming approach (static functions, immutable copies, tuple returns)
  - Added "Monte Carlo Logic" section explaining simulation methodology, inflation-adjusted calculations, and "fun points" optimization goal
  - Updated timestamp to 2025-09-18 10:00
- **Key Insights:** 
  - Confirmed optimal information density - comprehensive domain context without overwhelming implementation details
  - Established that the functional programming paradigm guides all architectural decisions
  - Clarified that all financial calculations use "today's dollars" (S&P500 growth minus CPI inflation)
- **Context Quality:** Document now provides sufficient architectural philosophy and domain knowledge for meaningful AI assistance across sessions

### Session 2025-09-18 Afternoon - SQL Optimization and Model Champion System

- **Issues Addressed:** SQL query performance optimization and model cleanup protection
- **Solutions Applied:**
  - Optimized `CleanUpModelAndRunResultsData()` query from inefficient LEFT JOIN + GROUP BY to performant NOT EXISTS pattern
  - Implemented complete ModelChampion protection system (entity class, database table, EF configuration, cleanup exclusion)
  - Updated versioning strategy clarification (patch vs minor version increments)
- **Key Technical Insights:**
  - NOT EXISTS typically outperforms LEFT JOIN + GROUP BY for existence checks due to early termination optimization
  - SQL Server query optimizer handles NOT EXISTS more efficiently than complex JOIN operations
  - Proper versioning: patch increments for operational changes, minor increments for simulation logic changes
- **Architecture Enhancements:**
  - Added ModelChampion entity with one-to-one Model relationship
  - Protected valuable models from automated cleanup processes
  - Maintained referential integrity with foreign key constraints
- **Version Management:** Updated to 0.18.1 (patch increment appropriate for operational/maintenance changes that don't affect simulation outcomes)

### Session 2026-02-18 (part 2) - VAR Diagnostics, 1980 Rationale, Config Pattern

- **Issues Addressed:**
  - Added large explanatory comment in `Pricing.LoadAndFitVarModel()` around the `year >= 1980` filter
    explaining the structural-break rationale (Bretton Woods collapse, Nixon price controls, oil
    embargoes, Fed regime change) and noting that the cutoff is a single-line edit to experiment.
  - Built `VarDiagnosticsWriter` HTML visualization tool (Chart.js line charts comparing 5
    hypothetical lifetimes vs actual historical data for SP500 price, inflation index, treasury rate).
  - Learned that the config system uses DB as primary store and appsettings.json as local overrides
    (opposite of what was assumed). New config values must be INSERTed into DB first.
- **New Files:**
  - `Lib/MonteCarlo/Var/VarDiagnosticsWriter.cs` — generates self-contained HTML diagnostic file
  - `Queries/var diagnostics config.sql` — SQL to INSERT the two new config rows into the DB
- **Modified Files:**
  - `Lib/MonteCarlo/StaticFunctions/Pricing.cs` — added structural-break comment for 1980 cutoff
  - `MonteCarloCLI/appsettings.json` — added `GenerateVarDiagnostics: false` and `VarDiagnosticsOutputPath` overrides
  - `MonteCarloCLI/Program.cs` — added diagnostic mode branch at startup (exits early when flag is true)
- **To generate diagnostic charts:**
  1. Run `Queries/var diagnostics config.sql` against the DB (one-time setup)
  2. Set `GenerateVarDiagnostics: true` in `MonteCarloCLI/appsettings.json`
  3. Run MonteCarloCLI — it writes the HTML and exits without running a simulation
  4. Open the HTML file in a browser; set flag back to false when done
- **VAR 1980 cutoff rationale (summary for future sessions):**
  Pre-1980 data introduces structural breaks: Bretton Woods gold standard (collapsed 1971), Nixon
  price controls (1971-74), oil embargoes (1973, 1979), and pre-Volcker Fed money-supply targeting.
  Including this data would degrade coefficient estimates for the modern market regime. The cutoff
  is a one-line edit; use VarDiagnosticsWriter to visually evaluate any alternative cutoff.

### Session 2026-02-18 (part 3) - VarDiagnosticsOutputPath Correction

- Updated `VarDiagnosticsOutputPath` from `/tmp/var_diagnostic.html` to
  `/media/dan/fdrive/codeprojects/PersonalFinance/OutputFiles/var_diagnostic.html` in:
  - `Queries/var diagnostics config.sql` (the DB INSERT default)
  - `MonteCarloCLI/appsettings.json` (the project-level override)
- Note: `VarDiagnosticsWriter.cs` already calls `Directory.CreateDirectory()` on the output
  directory, so the `OutputFiles` folder will be created automatically if absent.

### Session 2026-02-18 - VAR(3) Monte Carlo Growth Rate Generator

- **Issues Addressed:** Codebase was broken from an in-progress treasury integration:
  - SQL view `vw_hypothetical_lifetime_growth_rates` lacked `treasury_growth` but the C# entity required it
  - `Pricing.cs` had a `rates * decimal` compile error (`HypotheticalLifeTimeGrowthRate` had no `*` operator)
  - `CurrentMidTermInvestmentPrice` and `CurrentShortTermInvestmentPrice` were accidentally commented out in
    `CurrentPrices.cs`, causing ~20 compile errors across AccountCleanup, Investment, Rebalance, AccountInterestAccrual
- **Solutions Applied:**
  - Replaced SQL view circular-shift approach with in-process VAR(3) model (see ##Hypothetical Growth Rate Generation)
  - Created `Lib/MonteCarlo/Var/` namespace with MatrixMath, VarFitter, VarLifetimeGenerator
  - Created `HistoricalDataPoint` EF entity and `VarModel` record
  - Stripped DB attributes from `HypotheticalLifeTimeGrowthRate`; added `operator *`
  - Updated `PgContext`, `Pricing`, and `SimulationTrigger` to use new VAR pipeline
  - Uncommented the two missing `CurrentPrices` properties
  - Updated `PricingTests` and `SimulationTests` to compile against the new APIs
- **Outcome:** 0 build errors; all 1089 tests pass
- **Commit:** `456a53a` — "Replace SQL view Monte Carlo with VAR(3) model"
- **Note:** `git push` requires GPG passphrase entered interactively; push manually from terminal

### Session 2026-02-19 - Mid-Term Quarterly Dividend Reinvestment

- **Feature Added:** Quarterly dividend reinvestment for all mid-term (`MID_TERM`) investment positions
- **Design Decisions:**
  - Dividends paid in all account types (taxable brokerage, traditional 401k/IRA, Roth, HSA)
  - All dividends are reinvested (position Quantity increases; no cash deposited)
  - Tax-advantaged accounts (traditional, Roth, HSA): reinvest silently — no TaxLedger entry
  - Taxable brokerage accounts: reinvest AND record in `TaxLedger.DividendsReceived` and
    `TaxLedger.QualifiedDividendsReceived` (95% qualified per `DividendPercentQualified`)
  - Payment months: March, June, September, December (standard U.S. quarterly cadence)
  - `MidTermGrowthRateModifier` will be lowered separately by Dan to avoid double-counting
    price-return vs. total-return in the underlying SpGrowth series
- **Code Changes:**
  - `TaxConstants.cs` — added `MidTermAnnualDividendYield = 0.0334m`
  - `AccountInterestAccrual.cs` — added three new methods:
    - `AccrueMidTermDividends(currentDate, bookOfAccounts, taxLedger)` — public entry point; no-ops
      on non-quarter months; returns `(BookOfAccounts, TaxLedger, messages)`
    - `AccrueMidTermDividendsOnAccount(...)` — private; branches on `TAXABLE_BROKERAGE` vs. other
    - `AccrueMidTermDividendsOnPosition(...)` — private; computes `CurrentValue * (yield / 4)`,
      adds shares via `Quantity += dividendAmount / Price`
  - `LifeSimulator.cs` — `AccrueInterest()` calls `AccrueMidTermDividends` after existing price
    accrual; writes back `BookOfAccounts` and `TaxLedger`; dividend messages flow to reconciliation ledger
- **Tax flow:** `QualifiedDividendsAndCapitalGainTaxWorksheet` was already fully wired to consume
  `TaxLedger.QualifiedDividendsReceived` — no tax form changes needed
- **Outcome:** 0 build errors; all tests pass

### Session 2026-02-19 - Regression Test Coverage (36 C-Gap Items)

- **Goal:** Write xUnit regression tests for all 36 "C – Not covered" items identified in
  `Lib.Tests/TestStrategy/GapAnalysis.md`
- **Test files created (in order):**
  - `PayrollTaxExtendedTests.cs` — §2: Additional Medicare surcharge (0.9% above $250k salary)
  - `DividendReinvestmentTests.cs` — §4.3: All 10 dividend reinvestment outcomes; 2 tests
    marked `[KNOWN CODE BUG — EXPECTED FAIL]` because `AccrueMidTermDividendsOnPosition`
    updates Quantity on the existing position instead of creating a new DRIP position
  - `AccountDebtPaymentExtendedTests.cs` — §5: Investment liquidation when cash insufficient;
    debited = credited invariant; net worth conserved by debt paydown
  - `InvestmentSalesExtendedTests2.cs` — §6.1: CASH and PRIMARY_RESIDENCE excluded from sales
  - `RebalanceExtendedTests.cs` — §7.3: Partial long-to-mid conversion creates two positions;
    mid-term target already met → no movement
  - `WithdrawalStrategyExtendedTests.cs` — §7.4: Account type override bypasses income room logic
  - `AccountCleanupExtendedTests.cs` — §8: No PRIMARY_RESIDENCE input → none added to output
  - `AccountCalculationExtendedTests.cs` — §9: `CalculateDebtPaydownAmounts` clips MonthlyPayment
    to CurrentBalance via `Math.Min()` (tested with payment=$500, balance=$200 → $200)
  - `SpendExtendedTests.cs` — §10.3: Medicare Part A cost higher at age 75 than 65 (hospital
    admissions increase by 1/decade over 65); §10.4 was already covered by existing
    `CalculateExtremeAusterityMeasures_AboveTrigger_ExitsAusterityAtRightTime`
  - `VarPricingExtendedTests.cs` — §14: Treasury coupon additive (positive and negative delta);
    same lifeIndex → identical sequence; different lifeIndex → different sequence; floor clamp
    (theta=-0.10 → rate stays ≥ 0.001); ceiling clamp (theta=0.50 → rate stays ≤ 0.20);
    OU reversion (kappa=0.5, theta=0.04, initial=0.15 → converges to within 1% of theta in 12
    months with zero shocks); CopyPrices propagates CurrentTreasuryCoupon
  - `TaxCalculationExtendedTests2.cs` — §15: Empty ledger → income room = $94,300 + $29,200 = $123,500
- **Key patterns / discoveries:**
  - After `AccrueMidTermDividends` (and similar functions that replace `InvestmentAccounts` list),
    access results via `result.newAccounts.InvestmentAccounts.First(a => a.AccountType == ...)`,
    NOT via named properties like `.RothIra` (those go stale when the list is replaced)
  - `TestDataManager.CreateTestPerson()` uses `BirthDate = DateTime.Now.AddYears(-30)`; create
    person inline with fixed BirthDate when age-sensitive calculations are needed
  - For minimal `VarModel` in tests: use `LagCount=1`, zero `CoefficientMatrix` (4×3), diagonal
    `ResidualCholesky` (3×3); set `cholTreasury=0.0` for deterministic OU-only tests
  - GapAnalysis item §10.4 was misclassified as C; it is already covered
- **Outcome:** 0 build errors; 1140 tests total; 1138 pass; 2 known expected failures (§4.3 DRIP bug)

### Session 2026-02-19 - Treasury Rate OU Mean Reversion Fix

- **Issues Addressed:** VAR-generated treasury rates collapsed to near-zero in all hypothetical lifetimes
- **Root Causes Found (two bugs):**
  1. `treasury_growth` in DB was stored as `(prior - current) / prior` — sign inverted relative to
     standard growth convention. Rising rates produced negative values; falling rates produced positive.
  2. The VAR treated treasury rates like stock prices (multiplicative compounding). Treasury rates are
     mean-reverting; over 46 years with a slightly negative historical mean drift (driven by the 1980-1982
     Volcker spike), all synthetic scenarios converged to zero.
- **Database Changes (user ran two SQL updates):**
  1. Sign fix: `SET treasury_growth = (treasury_current_value - treasury_prior_value) / treasury_prior_value`
  2. Unit fix: `SET treasury_growth = (treasury_current_value - treasury_prior_value) / 100`
     (converts to absolute decimal change, consistent with CurrentTreasuryCoupon decimal representation)
- **Code Changes:**
  - `HistoricalDataPoint.cs` — added `TreasuryCurrentValue` property
  - `VarModel.cs` — added `TreasuryOuTheta`, `TreasuryOuKappa`, `InitialTreasuryRate`
  - `VarFitter.cs` — added `double[]? treasuryLevels` parameter; estimates OU kappa/theta via OLS
    regression of delta_r on r_{t-1}: `kappa = -beta`, `theta = alpha/kappa`
  - `VarLifetimeGenerator.cs` — tracks running rate level; applies OU correction each month:
    `correctedDelta = varDelta + kappa*(theta - currentRate)`, clamps to [0.1%, 20%];
    raw VAR delta (not corrected) stored in lag buffer to avoid double-counting mean reversion
  - `Pricing.cs` — three changes: query now fetches TreasuryCurrentValue; treasury update changed
    from multiplicative to additive (`+= rates.TreasuryGrowth`); `CopyPrices` now copies `CurrentTreasuryCoupon`
  - `VarDiagnosticsWriter.cs` — added `CumulativeAdditive` helper; treasury chart uses additive
    accumulation (in % display) with `firstHistoricalTreasuryRate` parameter
  - `MonteCarloCLI/Program.cs` — diagnostic branch updated to query and pass treasury levels/first rate
- **Outcome:** 0 build errors; all 1089 tests pass. Diagnostic shows treasury rates starting ~3.5%
  and fluctuating in plausible 0.1–10% range across all 5 hypothetical lifetimes. No collapse to zero.
- **Upcoming work:** Implement 2-year treasury notes as an asset class. Dan wants to model the financial
  trade-offs of holding some portfolio in treasuries vs. pure equities, and create new withdrawal/savings
  strategies that incorporate the treasury coupon (`CurrentTreasuryCoupon`).

#Current Focus Items:

- Lower `InvestmentConfig.MidTermGrowthRateModifier` (currently 0.5M) to avoid double-counting
  dividend yield now that mid-term dividends are paid separately from price growth
- Implementing 2-year treasury notes as an asset class (CurrentTreasuryCoupon infrastructure is ready)
- Designing withdrawal and savings strategies that incorporate treasury bond positions
- Ensuring the accuracy of the business logic in the Monte Carlo simulation
- Increasing runtime efficiency during LifeSimulator runs
